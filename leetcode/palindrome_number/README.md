## Task
Given an integer <code>x</code>, return true if <code>x</code> is a ***palindrome***, and <code>false</code> otherwise.

---

## Example 1
<pre>
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
</pre>
---

## Example 2
<pre>
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
